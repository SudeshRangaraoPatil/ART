The ART networks are known to solve the stability-plasticity dilemma i.e., stability refers to their nature of memorizing the learning and plasticity refers to the fact that they are flexible to gain new information. Due to this the nature of ART they are always able to learn new input patterns without forgetting the past. ART networks implement a clustering algorithm. Input is presented to the network and the algorithm checks whether it fits into one of the already stored clusters. If it fits then the input is added to the cluster that matches the most else a new cluster is formed.
